## API Rate Limiter

This is my attempt at building an API rate limiter. This is part of the [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/) where I'm taking up the challenge to build a rate limiter as a way to learn a new language. For this, I've chosen Rust as I want to keep on building more experience in Rust.

## Stack

- [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)
- [Serde](https://serde.rs/)

## Features

- Two endpoints: `/limited` and `/unlimited`.

## To run

Assumption: You've installed Rust.

Run:

```sh
cargo run
